Team vision/discipline trumps individuals/interactions (and process/tools)

Validated learning over working software (over comprehensive docs).
Validate learning means: we listen to customers, observe their behaviors, help them achieve their goals.

Customer discovery over customer collaboration (over contract negociation).

Initiating change over responding to change.
